# 📄 Pandas vs Polars: Benchmarking for High-Performance DataFrames

**🔍 Overview**

This repository benchmarks **Pandas vs Polars**, two powerful DataFrame libraries in Python, by measuring performance differences across multiple operations. Our goal is to evaluate whether **Polars’ speed and memory efficiency** justify a full migration from Pandas—or if a **hybrid approach** might be the best way forward.

This project was inspired from my love of exploring emerging technologies and push the boundaries of performance optimization, and I discovered that **Polars is significantly faster than Pandas, especially for large datasets**—in some cases, over **30x faster!** 🚀

***

### **📊 Benchmark Results**

I have tested multiple operations on datasets of varying sizes and recorded execution time and memory usage. The key findings are:

✅ **Polars significantly outperforms Pandas in sorting, joins, and groupby operations**\
✅ **Polars consumes less memory**, making it more efficient for large datasets\
✅ **Lazy execution & multi-threading** give Polars an edge, especially on large-scale computations

| **Operation** | **Pandas Time (ms)** | **Polars Time (ms)** | **Speedup Factor** |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Filter**    | 91.69                | 42.89                | 2.14x              |
| **GroupBy**   | 140.01               | 14.96                | 9.36x              |
| **Join**      | 895.65               | 51.07                | 17.54x             |
| **Sort**      | 1007.49              | 51.96                | 19.39x             |
| **Window**    | 65.39                | 30.55                | 2.14x              |

### **🛠️ How We Conducted the Benchmark**

#### **1️⃣ Dataset Used**

We generated synthetic data with **varying row and column sizes** to measure scalability. The dataset was processed using both **Pandas** and **Polars** to compare execution time.

#### **2️⃣ Operations Tested**

The following operations were benchmarked:

* **Filtering:** Selecting rows based on a condition
* **GroupBy & Aggregation:** Grouping data and applying functions like `sum`, `mean`, and `max`
* **Joins:** Merging two DataFrames based on a common key
* **Sorting:** Sorting large datasets by a column
* **Window Functions:** Applying rolling computations

#### **3️⃣ Execution Methodology**

* We used **Pandas (`pd.DataFrame`)** and **Polars (`pl.DataFrame`)**
* We timed each operation using Python’s built-in `time` module
* For **Polars**, we used `scan_parquet()` (lazy execution) and `collect()` for proper execution
* Plots were generated using `matplotlib` ,`seaborn`  to visualize performance

***

### **📸 Visualization**

The following charts summarize the benchmarking results:

1️⃣ **Memory Consumption:**

* Pandas consumes more memory than Polars, which stays efficient as data size increases.

2️⃣ **Polars Speedup Over Pandas:**

* Sorting and joins benefit the most from Polars, with **up to 27x speedup!**

3️⃣ **Performance vs Column Count (Filtering):**

* Pandas execution time grows rapidly with more columns, while Polars remains stable.

4️⃣ **Scaling Performance (Filtering):**

* As the number of rows increases, **Polars scales much better** than Pandas.

***

### **🚀 Why Use Polars?**

Polars is a **high-performance DataFrame library** that is optimized for large datasets and computationally expensive operations.

🔹 **Faster execution** due to parallel processing\
🔹 **Lower memory usage** with efficient memory allocation\
🔹 **Lazy evaluation** optimizes query execution\
🔹 **Rust-powered backend** ensures speed and reliability

***

### **🔧 Running the Benchmark Yourself**

#### **📥 Installation**

To run the benchmarks, install Pandas and Polars:

```bash
pip install pandas polars
```

#### **▶️ Running the Script**

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate the benchmarking results and save the visualization as `image.png`.

## **🧪 Experiment Control: Ensuring a Fair & Accurate Benchmark**

To ensure **fairness, consistency, and reliability** in our benchmarking between **Pandas** and **Polars**, we carefully controlled several factors. This section outlines the **measures taken** to make this comparison as accurate and unbiased as possible.

***

#### **1️⃣ Hardware & Software Environment**

🔹 **System Specifications:**

* **CPU:** (AMD Ryzen 7 5800x 8-core processor)
* **RAM:** _(NVIDIA GeForce 3060 RTX 12GB DDR6)_
* **Storage:** _(SSD)_
* **Operating System:** _(Windows 11)_

🔹 **Python & Library Versions:**

* **Python Version:** `Python 3.11.11`
* **Pandas Version:** `pandas 2.2.3`
* **Polars Version:** `polars 1.24.0`

***

#### **2️⃣ Dataset Design & Consistency**

To ensure that both Pandas and Polars were tested under identical conditions, we:

✔ **Used the same dataset for all operations**\
✔ **Generated data with a controlled distribution** (random but reproducible)\
✔ **Ensured datasets were fully loaded before execution**

**Dataset Details:**

* **Size Range:** From **10 thousand to 100 million rows**
* **Columns:** **5 to 50 columns**
* **Data Types:** Mixed (**integers, floats, categories, and strings**)
* **File Format:** **Parquet** (to avoid CSV parsing biases)

***

#### **3️⃣ Controlled Execution & Measurement**

To ensure accurate time measurements:

✅ **Used Python’s built-in `time` module** instead of `%%timeit` (avoiding Jupyter cell execution inconsistencies)\
✅ **Ensured cold starts** (avoided caching effects in Pandas and Polars)\
✅ **Flushed memory between runs** to avoid memory leaks\
✅ **Preloaded data into memory** to remove disk I/O effects\
✅ **Ran each operation multiple times** and recorded the average time

***

#### **4️⃣ Ensuring Fair API Usage**

Since **Pandas and Polars have different execution models**, we made sure:

* **Lazy Execution in Polars was explicitly collected** (`.collect()`)
* **Batch Processing was not biasing the results**
* **Pandas’ `category` dtype was used** when appropriate for fair performance comparisons
* **Both libraries were tested on their optimized paths** (e.g., `groupby().agg()` instead of slower custom loops)

***

#### **5️⃣ Limitations & Considerations**

Despite our best efforts, a few external factors could still impact results:

⚠ **Parallelism Differences** – Polars executes operations **multi-threaded**, while Pandas is **mostly single-threaded**.\
⚠ **Lazy vs Eager Execution** – Polars may optimize certain operations differently.\
⚠ **Dataset Size Impact** – Performance gains vary depending on dataset characteristics.

***

#### **📌 Summary: A Truly Controlled Benchmark**

By maintaining a **consistent environment, identical datasets, and fair execution**, we ensured that this benchmark **accurately represents the real-world performance differences** between **Pandas and Polars**.
